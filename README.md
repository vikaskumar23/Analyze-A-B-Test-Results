# Investigate Movie Dataset
The objective of this project to understand the results of A/B Testing on a website layout change run by a E-Commerce website.

## Introduction
For this project, we will be working to understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. Our goal is to work through the notebook given in repo to help the company understand if they should implement this new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

## Scope of the Project
In this project, we will go through the A/B Testing process and try to understand how it helps to understand that we can go with the change or its not needed. If we get significant benefit we will go with the change, but if there is no significant benefit then we will revert the change.
